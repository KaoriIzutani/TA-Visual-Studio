    <p>
        Known for years as either “marmalade cats” or “ginger cats", the orange
        tabby has been nicknamed to be distinct from the black tabby variety. 
        It’s no wonder that so many orange tabbies end up with names
        like Ginger, Big Red, Marmalade, or even Tangerine.

    <p>
        Orange cats tend to have a laid-back “cattitude” and can make them 
        excellent lap buddies and snugglers. On the other hand, it may make them
        more at risk for becoming overweight and obese.
